> *"Computing at the speed of light - literally"*

## üåü Vision

The Optical Brain project aims to revolutionize artificial intelligence by creating the world's first large-scale, three-dimensional optical neural network that processes information directly with light. By leveraging photonic computing principles, we're building a system that could potentially surpass current AI models in both speed and complexity.

## üî¨ Core Concept

### The Original Sphere Design
Our initial concept involves a spherical chamber filled with:
- **Adjustable mirrors** with remote-controlled reflection angles
- **Suspended optical elements** (diamonds, diodes, amplifiers) using magnetic levitation
- **Light modulators and attenuators** for signal processing
- **Direct optical input** for real-world visual data processing

### The Practical Fiber Implementation
For near-term feasibility, we're also developing a fiber-optic variant:
- **Kilometers of optical fibers** creating complex light pathways
- **Optical switches and multiplexers** for dynamic routing
- **Distributed amplifiers and processors** throughout the network
- **Programmable optical elements** for adaptive learning

## üöÄ Key Innovations

### üåê True 3D Processing
- Unlike current 2D chip-based optical neural networks
- Thousands of simultaneous light paths in three dimensions
- Exponentially more parameters than existing language models

### ‚ö° Speed of Light Computing
- Information travels at ~300,000 km/s through the system
- Minimal electronic bottlenecks
- Parallel processing capabilities far beyond current GPUs

### üëÅÔ∏è Direct Optical Input
